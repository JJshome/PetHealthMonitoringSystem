## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JJshome/PetHealthMonitoringSystem.git
cd PetHealthMonitoringSystem
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the demo workflow:
```bash
python -m examples.demo_workflow
```

### Testing with Simulated Data

You can simulate pet health data for testing using the following command:

```bash
python -m pet_health_monitoring_system.main simulate --pet-type dog --pet-name Buddy --days 7 --anomalies
```

### Analyzing Health Data

Once you have data (either real or simulated), analyze it using:

```bash
python -m pet_health_monitoring_system.main analyze --input-file data/simulated/Buddy_7days_data.csv --pet-type dog --pet-name Buddy --predict-diseases
```

### Generating Care Plans

Generate a personalized care plan based on the health analysis:

```bash
python -m pet_health_monitoring_system.main care-plan --analysis-file data/results/Buddy_health_analysis_20250507_123456.json --pet-type dog --pet-name Buddy
```

### Running the Web Interface

The system also provides a web-based dashboard:

```bash
python -m web_platform.app
```

Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000
